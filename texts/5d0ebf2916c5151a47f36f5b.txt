Iam amending the 2017 Senate Financial Disclosure to remove an asset that was inadvertently duplicated on the report. The Little Star Partnership is reported as asset number 59 and it
has an underlying asset listed at number 59.1. The underlying asset at number 59.1 was incorrectly duplicated and listed under asset number 42, Buhler-Telferner Partnership. The Little
Star Partnership has never been an underlying asset of Buhler-Telferner Partnership.
